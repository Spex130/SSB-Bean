Bean the Dynamite Duck
	A cuckoo crazy bird armed with Bombs. Lots and lots of bombs. Bean players will use the many ways that Bean has to deploy bombs to pester and annoy their enemies to death. 
	
	Unlike most Bomb users, Bean's bombs have a pretty short duration. They don't give you much use to simply hold them, though "cooking" them might give you an advantage.
	
	Some of Bean's specials are simply used to put bombs in different situations that you usually don't find thrown items. If Bean is holding an item, he will instead perform the intended action on the item.

Ground Attacks:

	Jab String:			[*]
		Marching Kicks
			Bean does the Triple Kick combo from Sonic the Fighters. 3 Button string.
