After baking an animation in Maya you'll end up with TONS and TONS of keyframes. This is a huge problem because excess of keyframes will bloat the animation's filesize. In order to fix that one would need to go to the Graph Editor and check every bone to delete any excess keyframes. However, there are some tools that make this process easier.

The first one is deleting completely flat keyframe channels. If you bake an animation to some bones that go unused you'll get many useless keyframes. Edit -> Delete by Type -> Static Channels gets rid of them.
The second one is simplifying curves. The Graph Editor has a tool called Simplify Curve in Curves. To put it in a way, it's like compressing an animation. You get fewer keyframes at the cost of the animation's quality. However if you go to this tool's options (the box right next to the tool in the menu) and use 0.01 for Time tolerance and 0.01 for Value tolerance it will get rid of most excess keyframes without killing the animation. Of course you can try other values, but the tool's so aggressive any value over them will most probably destroy your work.
And the third one is this script: http://www.riganimator.com/script-delete-flat-keys/ . After saving the script, go to the Script Editor (bottom right of Maya's main window), make sure you set the MEL tab and not the Python tab and load the script. Afterwards select all the text that just appeared in the lower text box and hit Run. Now you need to set values for the Angle tolerance and Value tolerance. With the default ones you should already see some results, but just like with the Simplify Curve tool you can play with the values. Unlike said tool, this one isn't as aggresive.
